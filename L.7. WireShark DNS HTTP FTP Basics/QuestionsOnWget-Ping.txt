Understanding protocol overhead at different levels of TCP/IP stack
Run "wget http://mirror.pramati.com/ubuntureleases/18.04.1/ubuntu-18.04.1-desktop-amd64.iso -O /dev/null" for 20s duration. Answer the following questions 
1. What is /dev/null?

2. What throughput range do you see when you run this experiment on your laptop? 

3. Use Wondershaper (https://github.com/magnific0/wondershaper) to limit your network speed to 1 Mbps. What throughput do you see now?

4. Run wireshark and compute the protocol overhead.
a) In wireshark session, look at packets downloaded to your machine corresponding to the ubuntu iso file. What is the size of each packet?

b) Compute the size of each header (Link layer, IP, and TCP). What is the protocol overhead i.e. the ratio of header bits to the actual data transmitted 


Measure latency using ping
Latency has 3 components, propagation delay, transmit delay and queueing delay.

1) Write down the latencies for each case
ping 127.0.0.1

ping www.google.com

ping www.iitmandi.ac.in


2) what is the relative ordering among the latencies? Why? Which component of latency majorly affects the observed results?
